Python utility that reads Metastock data files and save the quotations in
text files.
Full article is available here: http://themech.net/2008/08/reading-metastock-files/

Usage:
Run this script from the directory containing metastock data (it should contain
EMASTER file).

Listing the symbols in Metastock data:
python <path>/ms2txt.py --list

Extracting all quotes:
python <path>/ms2txt.py --all

More help:
python <path>/ms2txt.py --help

Notes (written by sanjkm):
- This program is verified to work on futures data from Metastock. It
should work on stocks, but I have no way to check this, so I don't know
for sure. If it does not, I've written some notes in the README-pandas
file which may help.
