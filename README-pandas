Python utility that reads Metastock data files and returns a pandas
dataframe containing all the data

Usage:

File ms2pandas.py contains the function ms2pandas.

from ms2pandas import ms2pandas

def ms2pandas(dir_path='', decimal_precision=4, ticker_list=[])

The function ms2pandas takes 3 optional arguments:

1) dir_path is the directory containing the Metastock data files.
If blank, dir_path assumed to be ''

2) decimal_precision is how many decimals places you want the data
taken out to in the dataframe. Default is 4 decimal places

3) ticker_list is a list of symbols that you want included in the dataframe.
If empty, by default it returns all the data in the directory. More
accurately, it returns all symbols listed in the EMASTER and the
XMASTER files in the directory. 

Notes:
- Different functions and routines are used to handle the symbols in the
'EMASTER' file (file numbers 0-255) and the 'XMASTER' file 
(file numbers > 256+). These correspond to the code directories
metastock and metastockX, respectively. If you make a change in one directory,
you should probably make the parallel change in the other directory.

- This has been verified to work on futures data only. In its original
form, it has worked on stocks, so I presume this is still the case. 
If it does not, I suggest looking at the variable line_padding 
(in metastock/files.py and metastock/mod_files.py). Changing this to zero
may work for stocks, but no promises there

- If Metastock alters their data spec in the future, as they did between the 
EMASTER and XMASTER files, then none of this code is likely to work 
on their new spec.
